# Compiler Phase 5

### Overview
I spent about **40 hours** on the fifth phase of this project. The target level is bonus (garbage collection and arrays).  

	* Added multi-class support
	* Variable initialization support
	* Polymorphism support, with runtime checking
	* Garbage collection using reference counts
	* Array support
	* All other requirements met

### Known Bugs
No known bugs, but there might be a few special cases that could break the Semantic Checker. I did extensive testing, so it should be okay.
